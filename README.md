# Welcome

You just learned tons of new technical stuff, and now you’re equipped with the skills to make you a junior developer. This next track will guide you through the process that will end with a job offer. Know that it will be really hard, and that’s why we have set up this track like a roadmap to prepare you for what’s to come. We know what it takes to get a developer job because we’ve done this with over 600 students over the past three years. That’s why we’ve set up the [Terms of Service](https://learn.co/tos) (also referred to as “TOS”) the way we did. If you stick to what we recommend you do in the TOS, you’ll be set up to get a job. 

We’ll take you through units that cover every aspect of the job search, including:

- Writing resume and cover letters
- Creating your professional brand, including Linkedin profile, Twitter, Github, and blog
- Networking
- Preparing for interviews (both technical and non-technical)
- Communication best practices (via email, phone, and in-person)
- Managing job offers

These lessons are meant to be tactical and actionable, and in some cases at the end of a lesson there will be an assignment for you to complete and submit. Make sure you don’t miss any of these.

You will also have access to a career counselor who will be in touch with on a biweekly basis once you finish the track and have done all the assignments. Your counselor will set goals with you, hold you to those goals, and will work with you for the next six months, or until you have a job. 

Just like in the program you just went through, everyone works at a different pace. There is no right or wrong amount of time to spend with this content. Don't rush through it and be thoughtful about the assignments. Everything you will work on in this track will impact your job search in some way. 

Similar to coding, jobseeking is a skill that takes time to learn and practice. Refer back to different lessons in this track throughout your job search process.
